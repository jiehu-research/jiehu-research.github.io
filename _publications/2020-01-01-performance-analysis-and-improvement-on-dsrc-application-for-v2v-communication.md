  In this paper, we focus on the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication adopting the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) application in periodic broadcast mode. An analytical model is studied and a fixed point method is used to analyze the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and mean delay based on the IEEE 802.11p standard in a fully connected network under the assumption of perfect PHY performance. With the characteristics of V2V communication, we develop the Semi-persistent Contention Density Control (SpCDC) scheme to improve the DSRC performance. We use Monte Carlo simulation to verify the results obtained by the analytical model. The simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio in SpCDC scheme increases more than 10% compared with IEEE 802.11p in heavy vehicle load scenarios. Meanwhile, the mean reception delay decreases more than 50%, which provides more reliable road safety.
